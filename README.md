# AdventOfCode
These are my solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles that are puzzles set on https://adventofcode.com/ as a Christmas Coding style Advent Calender.

Any programming language can be used, but as I'm mainly using PowerShell these days for a client, I chose PowerShell although I'm also doing it in Python with @drsquidnugget to help him learn. I've got a background in commercial software development in C/C++, Delphi and PHP, but these days as a Solution Architect and Network Security specialist, it's more scripting that I do.

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

The repo is structured by a year folder and then n_input.txt for the input text files and n_solution.[ps1|py] for the solutions.

Some took longer than others and differ in their level of difficulty. Some of the code isn't as pretty as I'd like to make them, but I don't have much time to spend on them, so if they work, it's all good. :)

Enjoy. :)
